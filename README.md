# Trip Advisor

This is my submission to frontend development intern task of Shopflo.

## Usage

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Install the required packages.
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

2. Start the development server.
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
3. Open the project in your browser at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) to view your project.

## Assumptions

The latitude and longitude values present in the response of the MockAPI were not correct. They were not showing up anything when provided to google maps. So, I have changed the Latitude and Longitude values which are working.
